# HTML and CSS Mentorship Task

This repository contains the task for the HTML and CSS mentorship position at GoIT.

## Template

You can view the template for this task [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_qwlYMPlWEl1bXAV3MB1lZLgDHR4pH_V).

## Execution Criteria

- **Do not use the Bootstrap library.**
- Utilize the SASS preprocessor for styling, with styles in separate files.
- Compile SASS using any tool of your choice (e.g., [Scout App](https://scout-app.io/)).
- Use the color palette available in the "Colors" section.
- Design layout using pixel units (px).
- The layout should closely resemble the template but doesn't need to be pixel-perfect.
- Ensure semantic HTML5 for the layout. Minimal accessibility is a bonus.
- Implement the layout grid using the GRID Layout method.
- Follow the BEM methodology for naming classes. Names should reflect their purpose.
- Use Google Fonts for fonts; local fonts are not necessary.
- Create the gradient effect in the banner (eagle image) using CSS and multi-layered background, not by cutting the image from the template.
- All icons should be in SVG format. You can find similar icons [here](https://www.flaticon.com/) or export them from the template. You can also use [IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/) for icons.
- Make icons interactive (change color on hover, similar to the template).
- Implement the hover effect in the "Team" section using CSS transitions (on hover, gradient appearance, icon block appearance).
- Ensure that team member images in the "Team" section are responsive for Retina screens. Original size and 2x size are sufficient.
- Make the page responsive for both desktop and mobile devices.
